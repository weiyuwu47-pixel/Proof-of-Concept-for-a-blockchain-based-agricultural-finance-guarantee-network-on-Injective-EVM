# Injective-based Agricultural Guarantee Network

This project explores how Injective EVM can be used to redesign
real-world agricultural loan guarantee systems through on-chain governance,
transparent rules, and off-chain execution.

The design is inspired by real product experience in provincial-level
agricultural financing guarantee systems in China.
